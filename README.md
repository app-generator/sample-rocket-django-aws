## Start with `Docker`

```

Once the above command is finished, the new app is started on `http://localhost:5085`

<br />

## Manual Build 

> Download/Clone the sources  

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/app-generator/sample-rocket-django-aws.git
$ cd sample-rocket-django-aws
```

<br />

> Install modules via `VENV`  

```bash
$ virtualenv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<br />
